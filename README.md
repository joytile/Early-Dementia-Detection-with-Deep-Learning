## Project Overview

This project shows an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for the prediction of dementia using a publicly available kaggle dataset.

## Dataset ðŸ“‚
The dataset provides a multifaceted view of factors that may contribute to the onset and progression of dementia. It is a valuable resource for researchers looking to explore the complex interplay between lifestyle, genetics, and health outcomes. 
Compiled from PUBMED, Online research sources, NHS, Google scholar and consultation with healthcare professionals. Available in this repositiory as 'dementia_data.csv'.
